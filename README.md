# Inventory-Sales-Analytics-for-E-commerce 
The Predictive Inventory & Sales Analytics for E-commerce system empowers businesses with real-time insights into inventory and sales, enabling data-driven decision-making. By identifying top-selling products over different time periods, businesses can optimize stock levels and ensure high-demand items remain available. The system also predicts upcoming demand using historical sales trends, helping businesses estimate the required stock for the next month and proactively manage inventory. Additionally, it analyzes customer return rates and refund reasons, allowing businesses to detect potential product quality issues and refine return policies for improved customer satisfaction.

To maximize revenue, the system determines optimal discount strategies by analyzing which discount levels drive the highest sales, ensuring promotions are both effective and profitable. It also helps prevent stockouts and overstocking by flagging products at risk of running out of stock or accumulating excess inventory. By identifying seasonal demand patterns, businesses can anticipate peak sales periods and align inventory accordingly. The system further supports clearance sales planning by tracking low-selling products and supplier lead time management, ensuring timely restocking based on supplier efficiency. Lastly, it improves customer retention by analyzing purchase frequency, enabling businesses to engage frequent shoppers and re-engage less active customers with personalized strategies.
